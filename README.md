# LLM chat bot - intelligent document processing for home loan applications 
In this project, I leverage the LLM power to create a chat bot, two services is deployed so far in ly application:
- FAQ home loan question for different user concerning topic such as market trends, eligibility, etc
- Automate document processing tasks for home loan documents,summarize and identify missing key info and recommand for approval

The Data ingestion focuses on processing data in two primary formats:
- **Web URLs**: Extracting and categorizing relevant information from various online sources.
- **PDF Documents**: Parsing and indexing local PDF files for inclusion in the knowledge base.

The processed data is chunked( into `Node` object represents a "chunk" of a source Document, whether that is a text chunk, an image, or other. similar to Documents) and uploaded to a Qdrant vector database, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval for query answering.


### RAG flow answering
The service leverages a Routing and Generation (RAG) approach to accurately answer user queries. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

- **Routing user's intent**: The `user's intent` will be analysed based on chat history and the current message and then a routing mechanism determines the `user's intent` and maps it to the appropriate topic (reference on 5 topics mentionning above) , corresponding to the collection name in the Qdrant vector database for retrieval. The routing process utilizes a custom prompt designed for the LLM model `gpt-4o-mini` using `Role prompting` and `few-shot prompting`, to set up the examples. 

- **Embedding user's intent**: The `user's intent` is embedded using the text-embedding-3-small model, which supports a maximum token limit of 8,192.

- **Retrieving Relevant Documents:**: The embedded user intent is matched against vectors in the Qdrant database to find similar documents, corresponding the collection name from routing approaching above. 

- **Generating the Final Answer**: The LLM combines the retrieved documents with the user's query and chat history to generate a comprehensive, context-aware response.

### Execute 

```bash
python3 backend/src/rag/rag_flow.py`
```

### Evaluate 

The evaluation metrics currently in use are:

- **Faithfulness**: Determines whether the answer accurately reflects the retrieved information.
- **Context Relevancy**:Measures how relevant the retrieved context and resulting answer are to the original query.

A golden dataset has been generated to evaluate RAG performance using several home loan FAQs from the topics mentioned earlier. The dataset can be referenced in `backend/test/rag/golden_data.py`:
Including 148 questions.

```bash
"collections": [
        {
            "category": "interest_rate",
            "questions": [
                "What are the current interest rates for home loans in 2024?",
                "How have home loan interest rates changed over the past year?",
                "What factors influence home loan interest rates?",
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            "category": "eligibility",
            "questions": [
                "What is the minimum credit score needed to qualify for a home loan?",
                "What documents are required to apply for a home loan?",
                "How does my debt-to-income ratio affect my loan eligibility?",
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            "category": "market_trends",
            "questions": [
                "Which states have the highest home loan demand in 2024?",
                "How do home loan rates differ in urban vs. rural areas?",
                "What are the top regions for refinancing activity in 2023?",
                "How does the housing market impact home loan trends in California?",
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            "category": "refinancing_policy",
            "questions": [
                "What are the current trends in home loan refinancing?",
                "How does a drop in interest rates affect refinancing activity?",
                ...
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Current Performance**

- Faithfulness Score:      85%
- Context Relevancy Score: 85%

Further optimization is needed to improve these metrics for better alignment and contextual accuracy in responses.
### Futher Improvement
- Expanding/adjust the knowledge base with more diverse data sources.
- Fine-tuning the embedding and retrieval models for better accuracy.

## Personnal home loan recommendation
### Introduction 
The service aims to predict and assess a home loan application, identify key missing values in the user's home loan application, and provide/summerize a final recommendation on whether the application is approved or rejected.

### System overview
![homeloan_recommandation](images/homeloan_recommandation.png)
### Methodologies
This service utilizes OpenAI agents for planning and integrates two specific tools:

-  Proposing agent prompt to collect the user's home loan application information based on the following mandatory fields from chat history:

```bash
{
    "name":           "Numeric or null",
    "income":         "numeric or null",
    "loan_amount":    "numeric or null",
    "property_value": "numeric or null",
    "loan_term":      "numeric or null",
    "loan_purpose":  ["Home purchase', 'Refinance', 'Cash-out refinancing', 'Home improvement', or 'Other purpose'. or null"]
}
```
- `detecting_missing_values`:This tool takes the generated home loan parameters as input to detect and validate missing key values:
    - If complete: The input contains all mandatory home loan information. The agent returns the payload with all the filled information required by the chatbot to the user.
    - If incomplete: The agent identifies missing values and requests the user to provide the necessary information.

After receiving a complete payload for a home loan application, the service uses an XGBoost model trained on the [HMDA dataset](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-browser/data/2023?category=states) as a prediction engine to determine whether the home loan application is approved or rejected.

The service summarizes the home loan application, including the status of the application (approved/rejected), and reports the result back to the user.

The downside is that it depends on too much the agent prompt where need to be polish and planning carefully to adapt with multiple 
scenarios.

### Fine-tuning

Fine-Tuning for JSON-Formatted Outputs in Home Loan Applications

This demonstrates fine-tuning a language model to generate consistent, JSON-formatted outputs for home loan applications. By leveraging user inputs and chat history, the model ensures the collection and validation of mandatory fields required for the application.

Notebook Link
The process for fine-tuning is detailed in `notebooks/finetune.ipynb`.

**Data Samples** 

The training dataset consist of multiples scenarios with different way to express the intent's user, with various expressions,
the outputs of the model is set up from recognizing the pattern and collect all information with relevant value.
I have built data training with 41 samples and test set with 24 samples.

Base model : `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`

Fine-tunning job : https://platform.openai.com/finetune/ftjob-ETvCNKRQL9sFw9z2eoOYLrsN?filter=all

```bash
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Given the mandatory fields: \"name\", \"income\", \"loan_amount\", \"property_value\", \"loan_term\", and \"loan_purpose\", validate and collect missing or invalid fields. Return a JSON object with the completed fields."}, 
{"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm John, and I earn 80000 annually. I want a loan of 250000 for my new home."}, 
{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"name\": \"John\", \"income\": 80000, \"loan_amount\": 250000, \"property_value\": null, \"loan_term\": null, \"loan_purpose\": \"Home purchase\"}"}]}


{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Given the mandatory fields: \"name\", \"income\", \"loan_amount\", \"property_value\", \"loan_term\", and \"loan_purpose\", validate and collect missing or invalid fields. Return a JSON object with the completed fields."}, 
{"role": "user", "content": "I\u2019m Sarah, and I need a loan for 150000. My property is valued at 500000. The loan term will be 30 years, and it\u2019s for home improvement."}, 
{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"name\": \"Sarah\", \"income\": null, \"loan_amount\": 150000, \"property_value\": 500000, \"loan_term\": 360, \"loan_purpose\": \"Home improvement\"}"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Given the mandatory fields: \"name\", \"income\", \"loan_amount\", \"property_value\", \"loan_term\", and \"loan_purpose\", validate and collect missing or invalid fields. Return a JSON object with the completed fields."}, 
{"role": "user", "content": "I\u2019m Sarah, and I need a loan for \u00e8\u00e9. My property is valued at 500000. The loan term will be 30 years, and it\u2019s for home improvement."}, 
{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"name\": \"Sarah\", \"income\": null, \"loan_amount\": null, \"property_value\": 500000, \"loan_term\": 360, \"loan_purpose\": \"Home improvement\"}"}]}

....
```
**Performance Improvements**

- Accuracy: Test cases show a 95% success rate across 24 diverse scenarios.
- Consistency: Fine-tuned responses maintain a predictable and structured JSON format.
- Efficiency: The model demonstrates reduced latency and improved prompt simplicity when compared to more complex prompts and larger models (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`).

The fine-tuned model ensures:

- Consistent validation and identification of incomplete or erroneous user inputs.
- Simplified downstream processing with structured JSON outputs.
- Enhanced user experience with reduced response ambiguity

As you can see the model release the different output with the same prompting (the fact that we minimize the prompt usage it's not necessary to provide few-shot prompting with output examples)
